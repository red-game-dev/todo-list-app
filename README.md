## Todo List App

A simple todo list app that allows of listing and create tasks (Does not support delete and edit)

Usage:

On root
```bash
npm run install:all && npm run dev
```

## Generic Details
- We're using redis to store the tasks, although in reality this should be in a database and redis just cache these and retrieve accordingly
- 

**Note:**  I know that we're not using Typescript, but in case the company looking as for someone that able to use it, this could be helpful to assses the ability of using Typescript. In case it would be more ideal to remove Typescript, can do so easily too :)
